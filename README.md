# LZSS - WORK IN PROGRESS
LZSS Compression, non-standard implementation.

Compression and decompression appears functional.
Quality Assurance and some code refactoring is the next step. Afterwhich I'll be creating a javascript implementation to complement the C++ code.

To compile this, run `make`
to compile this with debug output enabled, run `make debug`

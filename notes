Some things we want to do:
1) rebuild the compress function so that it uses bitwise operations.
2) new system should structure the data so that there's a 0 or a 1 before each binary byte.
	where a 0 means that the byte is literally a byte, and a 1 means that we're looking at a 
	size and offset combo.

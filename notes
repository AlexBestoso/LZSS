Some things we want to do:

1) ensure that movDictionary() functions how we expect it to function.
2) ensure that shiftLookahead functions as expected.
	this function should go from a populated buffer and slowly dissolve into all -1s
3) ensure that the class compiles.
4) test error handling system.
5) simplify what we can in the compress function.
